CityExplorer is a prototype that implement the concept of Computational Tourism, developed by a (small) team composed by me and [JÃ¼rgen Cito][cito] for [HackZurich 2017][hackzurich].

Actually, such project was ranked amongst the top 25 finalist projects and won the ESRI Award, a sub-competition for the groups that decided to rely on the API provided by such [company][esri].

Basically, we device an innovative way to build tourist paths, according to some particular constraints like the hours available and the time you want to spend for each site you visit.

A preview is available to the [Devpost][devpost] page of the project.
