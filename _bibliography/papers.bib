  abstract  = {Nowadays, Android represents the most popular mobile platform with a market share of around 80%. Previous research showed that data contained in user reviews and code change history of mobile apps represent a rich source of information for reducing software maintenance and development effort, increasing customers' satisfaction. Stemming from this observation, we present in this paper a large dataset of Android applications belonging to 23 different apps categories, which provides an overview of the types of feedback users report on the apps and documents the evolution of the related code metrics. The dataset contains about 395 applications of the F-Droid repository, including around 600 versions, 280,000 user reviews and more than 450,000 user feedback (extracted with specific text mining approaches). Furthermore, for each app version in our dataset, we employed the Paprika tool and developed several Python scripts to detect 8 different code smells and compute 22 code quality indicators. The paper discusses the potential usefulness of the dataset for future research in the field.},

  abstract  = {In the context of testing of Object-Oriented (OO) software systems, researchers have recently proposed search based approaches to automatically generate whole test suites by considering simultaneously all targets (e.g., branches) defined by the coverage criterion (multi-target approach). The goal of whole suite approaches is to overcome the problem of wasting search budget that iterative single-target approaches (which iteratively generate test cases for each target) can encounter in case of infeasible targets. However, whole suite approaches have not been implemented and experimented in the context of procedural programs. In this paper we present OCELOT (Optimal Coverage sEarch-based tooL for sOftware Testing), a test data generation tool for C programs which implements both a state-of-the-art whole suite approach and an iterative single-target approach designed for a parsimonious use of the search budget. We also present an empirical study conducted on 35 open-source C programs to compare the two approaches implemented in OCELOT. The results indicate that the iterative single-target approach provides a higher efficiency while achieving the same or an even higher level of coverage than the whole suite approach.},
