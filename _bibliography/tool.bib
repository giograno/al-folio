  abstract  = {Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearables are changing the way we do things, radically modifying our approach to technology. To sustain the brutal competition in the mobile market, developers need to deliver high quality applications in a short release cycle. 
Therefore, to maximize their market success, they aim to reveal and fix bugs as soon as possible.
For this reason, researchers and practitioners proposed testing tools to automate the process of bug discovery and fixing. 
In the mobile development context, the content of user reviews represents an unmatched source for developers seeking for defects in their applications. However, no prior work explored the adoption of information available in user reviews for testing purposes. 
In this demo we present BECLoMA, a tool to enable the integration of user feedback in the testing process of mobile apps.
BECLoMA links information from testing tools and user reviews, presenting developers an augmented testing report combining stack traces with user reviews information referring to the same crash. 
We show that BECLoMA facilitates not only the diagnosis and fix of app bugs, but also presents additional benefits: it eases the usage of testing tools and automates the analysis of user reviews from the Google Play Store.},
