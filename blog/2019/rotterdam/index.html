  <article class="post-content">
    <p>To talk about my experience in Rotterdam, I need to start from the last marathon of 2018, the Turin Marathon. A premise: I was not running under 2.20 since Florence 2016 and my personal best was still dated back to April 2015, in Hamburg. In Turin I ran 2.19 after a couple of years, with the last 7/8km of cramps (on a not very fast course). This left me with good vibes for the year to come: I would have been so happy to run close to my PB in 2019.</p>

<p>But then Barcelona came. Still cannot explain how, I ran 1.04.53, improving my PB on the distance of 83 seconds (dated back to Verona 2014). Suddenly, my expectations changed! I decided to run the Rotterdam Marathon, but a 2.17 target was not anymore a satisfactory goal for me. My preparation has been by far the best ever. In <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2171081639/overview">Naples Half Marathon</a> I ran another solid performance on the distance without a proper tapering: running 1.06.00 with a 31.57 for the first 10km (with strong head wind). Then, I finished 3rd in the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2218883156/overview">Mezza del Marchesato HM</a> (Saluzzo), with a 1.06.29 after a warm up of 12km. I also ran very strong long runs, like the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2188320279">38km-solo</a> with an average pace of 3’29”, or the double long run (<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2201683044">Saturday</a> + <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2203580031">Sunday</a>) with the big help of Francesco Puppi following me on the bike. Probably, the most impressive one has been my classic last hilly (<em>very</em> hilly) long run in <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2236414666">Santa Maria del Molise</a>. I ran this kind of training in Santa Maria in every marathon preparation, no matter where I was living: I always took a train/flight to go back home and do it. That’s my talisman and it tells me exactly how fast I can run.</p>

<p>On April 7th, Rotterdam Marathon day came! Long story short, it was the biggest disappointment of my life. I had no many options right after the start: the slower pacemaker was supposed to pass 66’ at the half. I ended up in a spontaneously formed group of about 20 folks running at 3’10” pace! Maybe a tad too fast, bus I was feeling enough comfortable. We run 67’ sharp at the half. Then, the group started to break a bit: from 20 to 25 we ran the fastest split in 15’48”, skimming the group to only 5 guys. Unfortunately, when I stated picturing my best day, I got touched on my foot from behind, I lost my balance and I violently fell on my right shoulder. It took to me a couple of seconds to realize what happened. Then, I got up as soon as possible trying to catch up the group again. I managed to do it in about 2km, maybe pushing a bit too much. As soon as I reached them, I lost contact again. At that point, all my good feelings were gone. My legs were just two wooden trunks. Despite the fall and the slowdown, the 30km split was still suggesting an estimated finish time below 2h15. I ran few slow kilometers more, alternating running and some walking before taking the decision to drop out. Funny fact: a doctor along the course saw me and, suggesting that my elbow could have been broken, brought me to the medical point close to the finish line. Luckily, my elbow was more or less ok: only a strong contusion and some scratches. Then, I walked toward the hotel. At first I met Rubén that tried to cheer me up. As soon as I saw the finish arch, I suddenly realized I did not finish the race and I busted into tears.</p>

<p>Not long after the race I took the decision to compete again in a short time. Probably, my shape would decline a bit but I am determined to close the sprint with a new personal best on the marathon. Next stop them, Hamburg.</p>
