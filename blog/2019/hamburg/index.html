  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Right after the dropout in Rotterdam, I was really determined to immediately race again. I briefly thought about the possible options in the following 3/4 weeks: Hamburg, Prague or Z√ºrich. Amongst the three, I chose Hamburg: I have already been there, I know the course and I was pretty sure to be able to find a good group of people at my target pace.</p>

<p>However, the period between Rotterdam and Hamburg was not the best for me. I had very bad feelings all along the way, with sore legs and my shoulder still hurting from my accident. Indeed, I started to wondering at some point about not racing at all. Luckily, Luciano convinced me to give it a try. He thought that I just needed to recharge my mental batteries and then I would have run a nice race.</p>

<p>I flew with Martina to Hamburg the Friday prior to the race. Since the elite hotel was full, we booked a close one on our own. I was in the list of the elite runners but I did not have the possibility to use my personal drinks. Therefore, with the help of my teammate Manuel (that finished 2nd in the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2324465558/overview">half marathon</a> üéâ) and his family, I arranged a perfect personal-drinks-along-the-course plan. Martina was supposed to wait for me at the 12km, while Manuel‚Äôs brother at the 16th. Finally, Manuel was scheduled to be at the half marathon with Martina again at the 28 and 35km.</p>

    Personal Refreshment Meeting

<p>We spent the Saturday planning those details and having a short tour at the expo. At 5p.m. we had the technical meeting at the elite hotel, followed by the dinner. On Saturday morning me and Martina had breakfast quite early in the hotel‚Äôs hall: some bread, jam, butter and a bit of protein from ham (along with a coffee, obviously). Then, we walked from our hotel to the elite one. From there, we all moved together to the start line. We had a dedicated room for changing our clothes and a sort of big inside parking area to do our warm-up. This was particularly nice considering that it was raining since the early morning.</p>

<p>After about 15 minutes of easy jogging with Giovanni Gualdi, I took my Vaporfly and did some sprints. They, we walked together to the start line, that was basically divided into two parts, the left one for the elite men, and the right one for the girls. To avoid pushes and fights at the start, I started on the girls side. At the end, I was not a very smart choice since they started slower than expected and I got stuck behind them for the first 100m üòÜ.</p>

<p>I spent the fist couple of kilometers trying to figure out with who I could have run with.  At the end, I ended up in a group with a Canadian (Trevor Hofbauer), a German (Frank Schauer) and an Hungarian guy (Peter Jenkei), along with two of the many Turkish guys in the top field.
We ran from the beginning at about 3‚Äô15‚Äù pace. In front of us a group mainly formed by Japanese and Turkish guys was running a bit faster (about 3‚Äô10‚Äù, the pace I was running in Rotterdam). However, differently for the Rotterdam, I was not feeling easy at all, not even at 3‚Äô15‚Äù pace. Moreover, after a couple of minutes the rain started to be more intensive and I my shoes very already pretty soaked. Given that I said to myself: ‚Äújust stay with those guys as long as you can and don‚Äôt even look at the time‚Äù. I just wanted to end the race with a decent result.</p>

<p>The race went smooth till my fist personal refreshment. I was waiting with Martina to be about 10 meter after the 12km mark but she was not there when I came üòÇ. ‚ÄúGood start‚Äù, I thought. Instead of the drink, I took the first of my two Maurten emergency gels I had in my pocket. At km 16 I regularly took the my nice <a href="https://www.sponser.ch/ch_de/bidon-330ml.html">Sponser‚Äôs penguin bottle</a> from Manuel‚Äôs family, and everything was smooth. Still, I wasn‚Äôt feeling particularly good but I had a nice group and I kept going.</p>

<p>The funniest thing happen at about the half marathon (we ran 1h08‚Äô30‚Äù halfway). According to our plan, Manuel was supposed to be there. I told him exactly were to stand. However, while looking for him, I saw a complete stranger with my same penguin bottle standing exactly where Manuel was supposed to be. I looked at him; he understood I was a bit confused and he just nodded with his head like to say ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs me‚Äù! This was such an hilarious moment. Later, I discovered he was a friend of Manuel that he sent there because he finished second in the half marathon and he had to stay for the price ceremony.</p>

<p>The second half in Hamburg is a bit easier. Many kilometers are slightly downhill, so I started to feel a bit more comfortable. At 28km Martina was finally there, wet like a drowned rat. I took my bottle with no issues. I took the last one again from her at the 35km. That‚Äôs where the race really started. Those are the more exiting kilometers in a marathon: if you still feel good you can ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the pain but still push through your limits. At that point, one of the Turkish guys tried to increase the pace. I immediately went after him, slowly followed by Frank and Trevor. As soon as we all reached him, he started to slow down, loosing contact with us. Basically, from then on, the three of us ran together till the last kilometer. The final part of the race was really exciting, since we caught many other runners that started faster: I think in the last 5km we passed something like 7/8 other runners. I was so excited that at some point I also started to incite the crowd with my arms üòÇ.</p>

<p>In the last 2 kilometers Trevor increased the pace and Frank lost contact. I was able to follow but maybe it was a bit too violently for me. The last kilometer was a tad uphill and Frank managed to caught and pass me. 200 meters before the finish line I looked at the clock below the finish arc. I realized I could have broken 2h17, so I pushed as much as possible but unfortunately the time stopped at exactly 2h17‚Äô00‚Äù.</p>

<p>I was happy for many reasons. I ran a strong time after many years. In Hamburg, I ran my PB 4 years ago and that was my last time running below 2h18. I also ran my personal best, which is always a nice thing. Moreover, finally I was able to break the record of my region, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molise">Molise</a> that was still standing from 1995.</p>

<p>For a lot of other reasons, I was also not satisfied. When I crossed the 30km mark I had a look at my watch and I saw a time about 2 minutes higher to the one in Rotterdam, at the same point. Moreover, I think that a guy running below 1h05‚Äô, like I did, is supposed to run about 2h15, especially if very <em>marathon optimized</em> like I am.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll definitively try again in the next autumn üòâ.</p>
