I was born in Campobasso (Italy) on April, 24th, 1990. I received (cum laude) the Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from the University of Molise (Italy) in 2013, advised by Prof. [Rocco Oliveto](https://dibt.unimol.it/staff/oliveto/).

Afterwards I moved to the University of Salerno, where in 2015 I received my Master’s Degree (cum laude) in Computer Science, advised by Prof. [Andrea De Lucia](http://docenti.unisa.it/003241/home), defending a thesis on Search Based Software Testing.

Just after my M.Sc. I worked for one year as IT Analyst and Developer at [Cedacri S.p.A.](http://www.cedacri.it/cedacri/en/index.html), as a developer for the banking sector. In November 2016 I started my Ph.D., joining the [s.e.a.l.](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal.html) group at the University of Zurich.

My main research interests include Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE), with a main focus on Seach-Based Software Testing (SBST), Software maintenance and evolution and Empirical Software Engineeering.

Passionate about research, coding, running and coffee.
