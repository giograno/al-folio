<h3>Short Story</h3>
I cultivate the passion of running since I was 13, inherited from my dad. While I never was a strong runner during my adolescence, I found my (still modest) dimension in the marathon. I managed to conclude my first marathon, at the age of 22, finishing second in Pisa with a time of 2:20:44. From there on, I never stopped to compete in the distance. In more than the last 10 year I have been coached by Luciano Di Pardo, a (strong) former steeplechase runner. I run for two teams: Nuova Atletica Isernia in Italy, and TV Oerlikon in Switzerland.
